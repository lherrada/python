Overloading Operators:
Suppose you've created a Vector class to represent two-dimensional vectors, what happens when you use the plus operator to add them? Most likely Python will yell at you.

You could, however, define the __add__ method in your class to perform vector addition and then the plus operator would behave as per expectation:


Data Hiding:
An object's attributes may or may not be visible outside the class definition. For these cases, you can name attributes with a double underscore prefix, and those attributes will not be directly visible to outsiders.

Python protects those members by internally changing the name to include the class name. You can access such attributes as object._className__attrName. If you would replace your last line as following, then it would work for you:

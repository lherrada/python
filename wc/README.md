This script is my own implementation of Linux command wc.

Side Notes about wc.py

1.- Performance:
As file size increases, the execution time of GNU wc version becomes remarkable better that my wc python version.
However, for sizes less than 100 MB the execution time is comparable.
 
Filesize       C GNU(sec)   python (sec)
104 MB     1.064               1.70
196MB       2.17                3.19
588MB       6.413              9.69  
 
Conclusion: It is difficult to beat compiled code over interpreted one.
 
2.-  Options: 
      All of the command options were implemented except one. 
      The handling of command line options is managed by module getopt.
      I decided to skip option 'L' since I could not figure out and efficient way to calculate maximum line length,
      I could have used brute force (max function or comparison of subsequent values) but that is computationally expensive.
 
3.- Data Source:
     I considered the 3 posible data sources:
     a.- several filenames from command line
     b.- Standard input
     c.- --files0-from=file option
 
 4.- Format of the output:
       I used right justification for the numbers and left justification for filename.
       The presentation of the data differs from the wc GNU but it is still nice.
 
 5.- Error Handling:
      I properly handle errors for the following situations:
      a.- Invalid option in command line
      b.- Non-existent file provided as argument.
          Script display error message for non-existent files 
          and correct output for the existing ones.
      c.- File is not readable or file type is a directory.
      d.- Option --files0_from used along with filenames as arguments.
 
6.- Comment on line counting:
      wc GNU implementation count new lines based on the number of character '\n' that
      it detects. So a "line" terminated with a null string (\0) is not counted. This occurs at the 
      end of file.
      For example generate a null terminated line:
      #find . -name '*' -print0 >nullterminated.txt
       Then do the line counting:
      #wc nullterminated.txt 
       0   1 269 nullterminated.txt
  
      Line counting is zero. 
      My script does count this null-terminated line
